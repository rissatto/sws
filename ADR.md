## 1. Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java 21
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3
- **Persistence**: Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Docker) / H2 for testing
- **Migrations**: Flyway
- **API**: REST + Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger)
- **Build**: Maven
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test

---

## 2. Why Flyway?

We chose **Flyway** as the database migration tool because:

- ‚úÖ Simple, SQL-based migrations
- ‚úÖ Excellent Spring Boot integration
- ‚úÖ Widely adopted
- ‚ùå Manual rollbacks, acceptable for our scope

---

## 3. Domain-Centric Design & Layering

```
com.rissatto.sws
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/     # Services & mappers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Core business models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/  # JPA entities, repos, config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/    # REST controllers, DTOs, error handlers
```

- Keeps business rules pure
- Separation of responsibilities

---

## 4. Idempotency for Operations

All write endpoints (`create`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `transfer`) accept an optional `Idempotency-Key` header to:

- Detect duplicate calls
- Return previously created resource or no-op on replay

---

## 5. Event-Sourced Balances

- Every mutation (deposit/withdraw/transfer) writes a `Transaction` record
- **Historical balance** computed by replaying all transactions ‚â§ requested timestamp
- Benefits:
    - üîç Full auditability
    - ‚è≥ Accurate historical snapshot

---

## 6. Concurrency Control

- Use **pessimistic locking** (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) when loading a wallet for write
- Ensures only one concurrent update per wallet

---

## 7. Error Handling

- Domain exceptions (e.g. `EntityNotFoundException`, insufficient funds) bubble up
- Caught by a `@ControllerAdvice` that maps them to `404`, `400`, etc.

---

## 8. Time Handling & Historical Queries

- Timestamps stored in UTC (`Instant`)
- Endpoint:
  ```
  GET /wallets/{id}/balance?at=2025-04-25T19:00:00Z
  ```  
- Always interpret `at` in UTC‚Äîno local‚Äêtime conversions.

---

## 9. Trade-offs

- **No auth**: out of scope
- **No balance snapshots**: historical replay on demand (could be slow)
- **No messaging**: direct DB writes, no event bus

---

## 10. Future Improvements

- JWT authentication & authorization
- Metrics/monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Snapshot background jobs for historical speed
- Migrate to event bus (Kafka) for distributed audit
